## 1. Design Philosophy
**Keywords**: Warm, Earthy, Vintage, Authentic, Lively Community.
The interface blends **rustic warmth** with **modern clarity**. It evokes the feeling of returning to a grandmother's home (Halmeoni-jip) but with the convenience of a modern app.
*   **Balance**: 50% Calm & Static (Empty House Aesthetics) + 50% Dynamic & Human (Social Activities).

## 2. Color Palette (Earth Tones)
### 2.1. Brand Colors
*   **Primary (Warm Brown)**: `#8D6E63` (Representative of soil, wood, and clay walls). Used for Primary Buttons, Highlighted Text.
*   **Secondary (Soft Clay/Beige)**: `#D7CCC8` (Soft background accents, cards). Used for Section Backgrounds, Hovers.
*   **Accent (Terracotta Orange)**: `#FFAB91` (Energy, Sunset, Warmth). Used for "Book Now", Notifications, Activity Tags.

### 2.2. Neutrals
*   **Text (Charcoal Gray)**: `#3E2723` (Deep brown-black for softer reading than pure black).
*   **Background (Off-White)**: `#FAF9F6` (Creamy paper texture feeling).

## 3. Typography
*   **Headings (Handwriting Style)**:
    *   **Font**: *'Nanum Pen Script'* or *'Gaegu'* (Google Fonts).
    *   **Usage**: Emotional titles (e.g., "Tonight's Stories", "Meet the Host"). Adds personal, handwritten diary feel.
*   **Body (Clean Sans-serif)**:
    *   **Font**: *'Noto Sans KR'* or *'Pretendard'*.
    *   **Usage**: Descriptions, Booking details, Reviews. Ensures readability and trust.

## 4. Imagery Style
*   **Dual Atmosphere**:
    *   **Static (House)**: Wide, cinematic shots of the empty house, nature, quiet morning light. Focus on texture (wood grain, stone walls).
    *   **Dynamic (People)**: Candid shots of guests laughing around a Bul-meong fire, sharing Samgyeopsal, making Kimchi. Focus on facial expressions and shared moments.

## 5. Components
### 5.1. Buttons
*   **Style**: Slightly rounded corners (`rounded-lg`), not full pills.
*   **Effect**: Gentle shadow (`shadow-md`) on hover to mimic tactile pressing.
*   **Primary**: Filled with `#8D6E63`, Text White.
*   **Secondary**: Border `#8D6E63`, Text `#8D6E63`, Background Transparent.

### 5.2. Cards (Property/Activity)
*   **Structure**: Clean photo on top, handwritten title below.
*   **Background**: White card on `#FAF9F6` background.
*   **Shadow**: Soft, diffused shadow (`shadow-sm`) to lift content slightly.
