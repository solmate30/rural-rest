## 1. Prototype Link/Screenshot
*   **Project Name**: Rural Rest V2
*   **Screen Name**: Grandma's Stone House Details
*   **Style**: Shadcn/UI Aesthetic (Clean & Floating)

## 2. Key User Flows (Demonstrated)
1.  **Immersive Hero**:
    *   **Full-width Image**: Immediately captures the "Modern Renovation" vibe.
    *   **Overlay Actions**: Back/Share buttons are placed over the image for max screen real estate.
2.  **Clear Info Hierarchy**:
    *   **Title**: Large Bold Inter font.
    *   **Host Trust**: Minimalist row with Avatar and "Superhost" badge.
3.  **Selection Cards (Shadcn Style)**:
    *   **Dormitory vs Private**: distinct cards with `rounded-xl` and `border-slate-200`.
    *   **Visual Cue**: Clear price difference and capacity.
4.  **Conversion Driver**:
    *   **Sticky Bottom Bar**: The "Reserve" button is always accessible, removing friction.
    *   **Color**: Warm Brown (#8D6E63) stands out against the white background.

### 2.5. Add-on: Gallery & Amenities Modal
Designed to address hygiene concerns common in rural stays.
*   **Layout**: Tab Navigation (Photos | Amenities) using Shadcn Tabs.
*   **Content**: Masonry Grid for photos (Bathroom focus), Icon List for Amenities (Bidet, WiFi).
*   **Goal**: Remove "Fear of the Unknown" (e.g., Is the toilet clean?).

## 3. Feedback & Improvements
### 3.1. Strengths (Keep)
*   **Consistency**: Perfectly matches the Landing Page's Floating Card aesthetic.
*   **Mobile-First**: The Sticky Bottom Bar is essential for mobile conversion.
*   **Whitespace**: Excellent use of spacing makes the dense text (descriptions, amenities) feel light.

### 3.2. Issues & To-Do (Fix before Logic)
*   [ ] **Gallery View**: The hero image needs a "View All Photos" button or grid indicator.
*   [ ] **Map Integration**: A small map snippet is still needed to show location context.
*   [ ] **Review Summary**: Clicking the star rating should anchor down to the review section.

## 4. Next Step
*   Design the **Booking & Payment Page** maintaining this clean, trustworthy style.
