          Context:
          - Repo: ${{ github.repository }}
          - PR Number: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
          - PR Head SHA: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
          - PR Base SHA: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}

          Review criteria (align with project AGENTS.md and dev-conventions; no emoji, text only):
          - Project conventions: monorepo (root = management, web/ = app), commit format type(scope): subject, TypeScript/Zod/Luxon, no .env in repo, docs in docs/01_Concept_Design etc.
          - Clear issues: bugs, security (guard clauses, no secrets), performance.
          - Use severity labels in comments: [Critical] [Security] [Performance] [Logic] [Improvement] [Resolved].

          Procedure:
          1) Get existing comments: gh pr view ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --json comments
          2) Get diff: gh pr diff ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
          3) If a previously reported issue appears fixed by nearby changes, reply: [Resolved] This issue appears to be resolved by the recent changes.
          4) Avoid duplicates: skip if similar feedback already exists on or near the same lines.

          Commenting rules:
          - Max 10 inline comments total; prioritize the most critical issues.
          - One issue per comment; place on the exact changed line.
          - Natural tone, specific and actionable; do not mention automated or high-confidence.
          - Use text labels only (no emoji): [Critical] [Security] [Performance] [Logic] [Resolved] [Improvement]

          Submission:
          - Submit one review containing inline comments plus a concise summary.
          - Use only: gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --comment
          - Do not use: gh pr review --approve or --request-changes"
