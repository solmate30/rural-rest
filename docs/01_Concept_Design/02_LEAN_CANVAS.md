## 1. Problem (The Pain)
1.  **Lack of Authentic Local Experience**: Global travelers are tired of generic hotels and "tourist trap" courses in Seoul/Busan. They crave "Real Korea" but can't find it.
2.  **Inconvenience & Fear**: Rural travel is hard due to **language barriers** and **lack of transport information**.
3.  **Rural Decay**: Huge number of empty houses (Empty Houses) are becoming eyesores, wasting potential cultural assets.

## 2. Solution (Our Core Features)
1.  **Curated Rural Stays**: Renovating empty houses into "Vintage & Comfort" accommodations (Dorm + Private).
2.  **Frictionless Access**:
    *   **Auto-Translation Chat**: Eliminates language anxiety.
    *   **Transport Concierge**: Direct booking for shuttles/taxis to hard-to-reach villages.
3.  **Community & Activity**: Pre-booking for "Bul-meong", "Kimchi Making", and village tours to ensure deep engagement.

## 3. Unique Value Proposition (UVP)
> **"Rebirth of Empty Houses, Revival of Connections."**
> The only platform that turns Korea's rural crisis (empty houses) into its greatest tourism asset (authentic hospitality), providing a seamless bridge for global travelers to experience the true warmth of "Jeong" (정).

## 4. Unfair Advantage (Moat)
1.  **Exclusive Inventory**: Direct partnerships with local governments and village elders to secure unique empty houses that competitors cannot access.
2.  **Integrated Experience**: Unlike Airbnb (Room only), we control the entire journey from "How to get there" to "What to do tonight (Bul-meong)".

## 5. Customer Segments
*   **Early Adopters**: Western Backpackers & Adventure Seekers (Age 20-35).
*   **Digital Nomads**: Looking for quiet, affordable, long-term stays with Wi-Fi.
*   **Domestic Healing Seekers**: Koreans wanting a "Chon-캉스" weekend getaway.

## 6. Key Metrics
*   **Retention Rate**: Do they come back? (Proof of satisfaction).
*   **Occupancy Rate**: How well are we reviving the empty houses?
*   **NPS (Net Promoter Score)**: Would they recommend this "uncomfortable but romantic" experience to friends?

## 7. Revenue Streams
*   **Commission**: 10-15% fee on bookings.
*   **Experience Add-ons**: Margin on "Bul-meong Kit", "BBQ Set", "Local Tours".
*   **Concierge Fee**: Small fee for transport arrangements.
