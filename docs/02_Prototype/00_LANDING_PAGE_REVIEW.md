## 1. Prototype Link/Screenshot
*   **Project Name**: Rural Rest V2
*   **Screen Name**: Landing Page (Variant 1)
*   **Style**: Shadcn/UI Aesthetic (Floating Card)

## 2. Key User Flows (Demonstrated)
1.  **First Impression**:
    *   **Hero**: Emotional, full-width rural image.
    *   **Search**: A "Floating Card" overlay for Location/Date/Guests. This is a classic, high-converting pattern.
2.  **Discovery**:
    *   **"Popular Stays"**: Clean grid layout. Cards feature rounded corners (`rounded-xl`), subtle borders (`border-slate-200`), and clear typography (Inter).
    *   **"Unforgettable Moments"**: Horizontal scroll for activities (Fire Gazing, etc.).

## 3. Feedback & Improvements
### 3.1. Strengths (Keep)
*   **Modernity**: The switch to Shadcn/UI style makes the platform look much more trustworthy and professional compared to the previous "Vintage" only attempt.
*   **Readability**: The Inter font and ample whitespace make information easy to scan.
*   **Visual Hierarchy**: The Floating Search Card naturally draws the eye as the primary action.

### 3.2. Issues & To-Do (Fix before Logic)
*   [ ] **Mobile Optimization**: Check if the floating card covers too much of the hero image on smaller screens.
*   [ ] **Navigation**: Ensure the "Menu" icon is easily accessible for thumb reach.

## 4. Next Step
*   Design the **Property Detail Page** maintaining this "Clean & Floating" aesthetic.
