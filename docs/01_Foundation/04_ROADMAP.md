This roadmap defines the strategic execution plan for **Rural Rest**, prioritizing the most critical features for solving key problems first (e.g., transport barriers).

## 1. NOW (Short-term: 3-6 Months)
**(Focus: MVP Validation & Friction Removal)**

*   **Pilot Launch (5 Houses)**: Renovate and list 5 diverse empty houses as "Signature Stays".
*   **Essential Booking Flow**:
    *   Search/Filter by Room Type (Dorm/Private).
    *   **PayPal/Stripe Integration** for Global Payments.
    *   **Auto-Translation Chat**: The #1 barrier removal for foreign guests.
*   **Manual Concierge**: Provide a "Transport Request" feature (initially handled manually by admins) to solve the "Last Mile" problem.

## 2. NEXT (Mid-term: 6-12 Months)
**(Focus: Experience Deepening & Automation)**

*   **Expansion (20 Houses)**: Scale inventory based on pilot feedback.
*   **Local Experience Platform**:
    *   Allow guests to browse and book specific village activities (e.g., "Kimchi Making Class", "Village Walking Tour").
    *   Host-side "Activity Manager" dashboard.
*   **Transport Automation**: API integration with local taxi/shuttle services.
*   **Community Features**: Guest Lounge (Bulletin Board) for carpooling and meetups.
*   **Digital Key System (Optional)**:
    *   QR code-based smart lock integration for seamless check-in.
    *   Available as an optional upgrade for hosts with smart door locks.
    *   Maintains balance between convenience and hospitality (hybrid model).
    *   See [Digital Key System Design](../04_Logic/03_DIGITAL_KEY_SYSTEM.md) for details.

## 3. LATER (Long-term: 1-3 Years)
**(Focus: Ecosystem & Governance)**

*   **Network (100+ Houses)**: Establish a nationwide "Rural Stay Network".
*   **Gamification**: Introduce "Eco-Points" or "Rural Stamps" for sustainable travel behavior.
*   **Village Governance**: Empower local communities to manage bookings and reinvest profits directly.
*   **Global Expansion**: Replicate the model in other countries facing rural depopulation (e.g., Japan's Akiya).
